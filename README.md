# Vagrant_Kali

This is my set up for a base Kali Linux Pentesting VM - Automated using Vagrant and Ansible. It Uses the official [Hashicorp Vagrant Box](https://app.vagrantup.com/kalilinux/boxes/rolling) and currently only runs on VirtualBox. The default credentials for vagrant machines are shown below:

| Username  | Password  |
|---|---|
| vagrant  | vagrant |

## Setup

In order to run the Vagrant file, you need the following:
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Guest Addition Plugin for Vagrant](https://www.serverlab.ca/tutorials/virtualization/how-to-auto-upgrade-virtualbox-guest-additions-with-vagrant/)
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

Once you have the required items installed, you can simply run the following terminal command:

```bat
vagrant up
```

I have tested this on both Linux (Fedora 32) and Windows (Windows 10) machines - With Windows 10, this [guide](https://geekflare.com/ansible-installation-windows/) describes how to install Ansible using either Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for Linux. If you run into any issues, please let me know!

## Configuration Files

The installation makes use of 2 Ansible playbooks and 2 condifguration file:

| setup_playbook.yml  | The Setup Playbook updates the Kali VM and installs tooling that I find useful. |
| software_playbook.yml  | The Software Playbook downloads general software that I make use of during pentests and some basic scripts. |
| bash_aliases  | Creates a few simple bash aliases from scripts that I created which I generally make use of.  |
| tmux_config  | My Tmux configuration file which includes tmux-logging. |

## Future Work
* Create a Base Windows VM build with similar functionality.
* Port functionality to a Parrot OS version.
