# Vagrant_Kali

This is my set up for a base Kali Linux Pentesting VM - Automated using Vagrant and Ansible. It Uses the official [Hashicorp Vagrant Box](https://app.vagrantup.com/kalilinux/boxes/rolling) and currently only runs on VirtualBox. The default credentials for vagrant machines are shown below:

| Username  | Password  |
|---|---|
| vagrant  | vagrant |

## Setup

In order to run the Vagrant file, you need the following:
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* [Guest Addition Plugin for Vagrant](https://www.serverlab.ca/tutorials/virtualization/how-to-auto-upgrade-virtualbox-guest-additions-with-vagrant/)
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

### Running with Ansible on host

Once you have the required items installed, you can download the `VM_Setup` configuration and simply run the following terminal command:

```bat
vagrant up
```

### Running without Ansible on host 

If you are running it from Windows or if you would prefer to have the Ansible scripts run from the Kali machine itself, I have included `VM_Setup_Contained` to do that for you. The main difference is that Vagrant will place the playbooks onto the Kali Vagrant Desktop and run them from there after installing Ansible on the Kali machine. Within the Ansible playbooks, the first 2 lines also changed - It replaces the `hosts: all` with the following:

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
```

## Configuration Files

The installation makes use of 2 Ansible playbooks and 2 configuration files:

| File  | Description  |
|---|---|
| setup_playbook.yml  | The Setup Playbook updates the Kali VM and installs tooling that I find useful. |
| software_playbook.yml  | The Software Playbook downloads general software that I make use of during pentests and some basic scripts. |
| bash_aliases  | Creates a few simple bash aliases from scripts that I created which I generally make use of.  |
| tmux_config  | My Tmux configuration file which includes tmux-logging. |
